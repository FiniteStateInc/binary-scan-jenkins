## Introduction

The Finite State `binary-scan` Extension allows you to easily integrate the Finite State Platform into Jenkins.

Following the steps below will:

* Upload the file to the Finite State platform
* Create a new version of the configured asset
* Conduct a Quick Scan binary analysis on the uploaded file
* Associate the results to the asset version

By default, the asset version will be assigned the existing values for Business Unit and Created By User. If you need to change these, you can provide the IDs for them.

This plugin gives you the ability to add a Post Build action for:

- Freestyle projects
- Multi-configuration project

## Getting started

5. Complete the fields following the below reference. For sensitive fields like `Finite state API client`, `Finite State API client ID` and `Finite state organization context` we use the credentials plugin, so, be sure to create the credentials for each of this fields and select the correct ones on each dropdown.
